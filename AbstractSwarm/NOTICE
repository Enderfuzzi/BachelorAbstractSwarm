AbstractSwarm is a graphical multi-agent modeling and simulation environment,
especially suitable for applying AI to logistics.
It is currently further developed as an open source project under the GPL
license (Version 3) and it is planned to be used for optimizing hospital
processes.

AbstractSwarm is free software and was created by making use of other free
software with the following licenses and websites:

- Xerces-C++ 3.2.2 (Apache License 2.0; https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c)
- MinGW (License: http://mingw.org/license; http://mingw.org/)

It is tried to satisfy the terms of all licenses by providing a copy of the
respective license files and the source codes involved in the AbstractSwarm
folder, where required.
If anything is missing or wrong, or in case you need access to further source
