/**
 * This class provides the three methods of the AbstractSwarm agent interface 
 * for state perception and performing actions, communication with other agents
 * and the perception of rewards.<br />
 * <br />
 *

 *                 no frequency attribute<br />
 * .necessities    the number of remaining visits for each connected station,
 *                 -1 if the agent's type has no necessity attribute<br />          
 * .cycles         the number of remaining cycles for each incoming visit edge;
 *                 -1 if agent's type has no cycle attribute<br />
 * .time           the remaining time on the target station, -1 if agent is
 *                 currently not visiting a station or if agent's type has no
 *                 time attribute<br />
 * .target         the agent's current target<br />

 *                 (note that, by definition, agent types cannot have place
 *                 edges and thus this list will always be empty; this is only
 *                 for backwards compatibility/unification reasons)<br />
